# Machine Learning Roadmap

## Overview
This repository documents my step-by-step learning journey in Machine Learning, with a focus on building strong and practical foundations using Python.

The goal of this roadmap is to develop a solid understanding of core concepts such as data analysis, mathematical fundamentals, and classical machine learning algorithms, as preparation for advanced studies in AI/ML.

## What I'm Learning
- Python for data analysis
- NumPy and Pandas
- Mathematical foundations for Machine Learning
- Core Machine Learning concepts and algorithms

## Repository Structure
- `python/` – Python basics and practice notebooks
- `numpy/` – NumPy exercises and experiments
- `pandas/` – Data manipulation and analysis
- `math/` – Math concepts relevant to ML
- `learning-log.md` – Weekly learning progress and notes

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Status
This repository is actively maintained and updated as I progress through my Machine Learning learning path.
